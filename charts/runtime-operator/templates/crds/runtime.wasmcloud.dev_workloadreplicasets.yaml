                            WorkloadComponent represents a component of a workload.
                            Components are stateless, invocation-driven units of computation.
                            Components are isolated from each other and can be scaled independently.
                            Each Component has a Root WIT World, representing the Components imports/exports. The combined
                            list of all Components' Root WIT Worlds within a workload must be compatible with the Host's WIT World.
                            All components within a workload are guaranteed to be placed on the same Wasm Host.

                          Services can import interfaces from any Component within the same workload, or from the Host.
